# TrailSeeker

A Java mobile app with a PHP backend to share GPS based trails. This project was designed and developed during my Honours year as part of a Mobile Development topic in 2012. Please note that the server no longer exists, nor do any of the included credentials so to use this project you would need to recompile after self-hosting the server and updating credentials.

Included in this GitHub are:
 * A report detailing the design of this project (report.pdf)
 * An APK containing the application (TrailSeeker.apk)
 * The Android Eclipse project (FragmentTabs)
 * The PHP Server code (ServerCode)
 * The excluded original custom point rendering method.
 	- Dumped Additional Code contains the Android version.
 	- PointMapper contains the XNA version.
